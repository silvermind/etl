=== What's that ?

Logstash is a tool for collecting, analyzing, formatting and redistributing streams of strings (logs for example) via configuration files and plugins.

The differents settings  of logstash are defined in configuration files.

A Logstash pipeline has two required elements, <<dataforwarders/logstash.adoc#Logstash inputs,inputs>> and <<dataforwarders/logstash.adoc#Logstash outputs,outputs>>, and one optional element, <<dataforwarders/logstash.adoc#Logstash filters,filters>>.

The input plugins consume data from a source, the filter plugins modify the data as you specify, and the output plugins write the data to a destination.

To configure logstash please refer to <<dataforwarders/logstash.adoc#,logstash>>
